		You should see in the command prompt looking window:
			audio input device #1 - 'CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual'
			audio input device #2 - 'Microphone Array (IDI High Defi'
	
			audio output device #1 - 'Speakers / Headphones (IDI High'
			audio output device #2 - 'CABLE input (VB-Audio Virtual C'

			audio input device #1 (CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual ) initialized
			audio output device #2 (CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual C) initialized

			When clicking configure in the "DSD Interface" you may have to mess with the command line
				-O NUL -I0 -M15 -v2 -i1 -o2 ...  (-i2 -o2 was what was needed on VM)
					-i1 is input device 1
					-o2 is output device 2
						may need to change these 2 values so the above output is correct
